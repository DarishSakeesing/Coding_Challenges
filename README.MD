# Introduction

This repository will hold all the coding challenges I attempt on Leetcode.com. Since the daily coding challenge is selected at random from their entire question base, the difficulty of the challenges ranges from *Easy* to *Hard*.

## Motivation

I decided to have such a repository for 2 reasons:
- to showcase my skills in *efficient* computer algorithms
- to keep a record of the challenges I attempt while I embark upon the job search.

## Contributing

If while reading, you notice that an algorithm can be more efficient, you can open a pull request and I will review the code and give you credit in the documentation.

Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.
